We have done a deepdive to construct the following tabel for KPIs:

| Dimension                | Qualcomm (QCOM)                                                             | Axon (AXON)                                                                            |

| **Key External Drivers** | Global smartphone demand, 5G/6G cycles, competition from other chip vendors | Public safety policies, gov budgets, adoption of body cams & less-lethal tech          |
| **Key Internal Drivers** | R&D, design wins, IP licensing model robustness                             | Innovation cadence, platform breadth (TASER + sensors + SaaS), execution on ARR growth |
| **Most Important KPIs**  | QCT mix, QTL stability, gross margin, AI/Auto/IoT traction                  | ARR/software growth, NRR/churn, device base + attach rates, EBITDA margin              |
