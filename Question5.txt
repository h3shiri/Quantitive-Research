Portfolio Analytics. A portfolio manager approaches you with the following questions,
describe how you would approach each one. The portfolio is $1B in GMV, includes 50 software securities, has 80% idio variance when measured by a multi-factor risk model with 50 factors, historically trades about $100M per month, and has performed at a 2
 
Sharpe and 1.5 IR over the last 2 years. Limit each response to a maximum of 3 sentences.
-- My momentum exposure is higher than two weeks ago, what could be driving that?
-- The risk model says that I have no Beta exposure, but it feels like I do, can you check?
-- The risk model says that my portfolio has $2M of daily idio vol, but it feels more volatile than that, what could be going on?
-- I’m not sure how well I’m timing my trades, will you help me quantify my timing skill?
-- I have 50 positions in my portfolio, some larger than others, how should I think about measuring the concentration of position sizes?
-- My Sharpe is higher than my IR, how can I find the drivers of those differences? 
-- I’ve been losing money on FOMC and CPI days, will you help me understand why
and quantify it for the future?
