We would approach this in several stages.

First, we need to determine which features to use for constructing the new index:

A) Market/Price Features
– Historical returns (1m/3m/6m/12m)
– Volatility
– Liquidity measures such as bid-ask spread
– Momentum factor
– Size

B) Fundamental/Business Features
– Revenue
– Earnings
– Debt
– R&D expenditure as a percentage of budget

C) Textual/NLP-Based Features
– Company descriptions
– Filing statements and news sources
We would embed these texts and look for similarities.

Second, we can take all of these features (or select a subset), apply PCA or other dimensionality-reduction methods, and then run clustering algorithms such as K-means or spectral clustering.

Finally, we would evaluate whether the resulting clusters make economic sense and whether they provide better risk-adjusted performance over time compared to standard sector indices.
